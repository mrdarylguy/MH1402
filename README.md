# MH1402 Algorithms and Computing II
Repo for NTU module on C++ programming


 This module has since been discontinued for Physics majors in NTU favour of Python programming.

 Though I have obtained the relevant materials from senior students and am picking it up on my own. 

## Compiler

The ***MinGw*** compiler is used

It is installed at the command line for M1 Mac using `arch -x86_64 brew install MinGW-w64`
